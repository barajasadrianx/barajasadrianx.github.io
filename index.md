Adrian Barajas' Portfolio

I'm an Electrical Engineering major, however, I like Computer Science.

Favorite C120L labs

    In Lab 1, I learned version control, software development tools, and programming by creating a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++ using Git, GitHub, Visual Studio, and Linux. First, I set up a Git repository locally on my Linux system, initialize it with git and created a C++ source file (hello_world.cpp). The file contained a basic main () function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. I used GitHub to create a remote repository, link it to my local repository using git remote add, and pushed the code with git push. I used Visual Studio's powerful IDE to write, build, and test the program ensuring it compiled and ran correctly. I also used Google C++ Style command to format the code. This lab was my favorite because I started to learn new skill I didn’t know before.

    In lab 2, we reinforced what we learned in lab 1. The foundational skills for using Git and GitHub to manage and submit code effectively. I practiced cloning a repository, making changes locally, and pushing updates back to GitHub for grading. Additionally, I gained an understanding of Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for secure authentication and configured my Git environment to streamline interactions with GitHub. The lab also emphasized the importance of writing well-formatted code and ensuring it passes automated checks before submission. 

    In lab 3, I learned several fundamental programming concepts and practical skills in C++. I gained experience with defining and using functions by creating BMRMan and BMRWoman to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) for men and women, reinforcing modular programming. I also practiced implementing mathematical formulas using variables, arithmetic operations, and constants, translating real-world equations into code. Through the use of std::cin and std::cout, I improved my ability to interact with users by accepting inputs and displaying outputs. Additionally, I worked with data types like double and int, understanding the importance of selecting appropriate types for precision and memory efficiency.
